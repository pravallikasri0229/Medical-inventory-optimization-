# Medical-inventory-optimization-
Overview
This project focuses on optimizing the inventory management of medical supplies to ensure that healthcare facilities maintain an adequate stock of necessary items. The project involved extensive data analysis, preprocessing, and the creation of an interactive dashboard to assist in decision-making.

Objectives
To analyze the current inventory data and identify patterns and trends.
To preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
To develop a dashboard that provides actionable insights for inventory management.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involved:

Understanding the structure of the dataset.
Analyzing key variables such as inventory levels, item demand, and supply timelines.
Identifying trends, seasonality, and potential outliers.
Visualizing data to uncover insights that could inform inventory decisions.
Key Findings:

Certain items have high demand variability, requiring dynamic stock management.
Some inventory items have consistent overstock, leading to higher holding costs.
Lead times for certain suppliers contribute to stockouts, highlighting the need for alternative sources.
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps included:

Handling missing values: Imputed missing data points to maintain dataset integrity.
Data normalization: Standardized numerical data to improve model performance.
Outlier treatment: Identified and managed outliers to avoid skewing results.
Feature engineering: Created new features like moving averages to capture trends over time.


Dashboard
An interactive dashboard was developed using Power BI to visualize and monitor key metrics related to medical inventory. The dashboard features:

Inventory Status: Overview of current stock levels across all items.
Demand Forecast: Predicted demand for critical items based on historical data.
Supplier Performance: Analysis of lead times and reliability of different suppliers.
Cost Analysis: Breakdown of holding costs, stockouts, and potential savings from optimization.


Tools & Technologies
Python: For EDA and data preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Power BI: For dashboard creation and data visualization.
Excel: For initial data handling and basic analysis.


Results & Insights
The analysis and dashboard provided actionable insights that can help healthcare facilities:
Reduce holding costs by optimizing order quantities.
Minimize stockouts by improving demand forecasting and supplier management.
Make data-driven decisions to maintain an optimal inventory level.
